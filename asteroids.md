* fisheye distortion etc.
* screen shake & compression blasts
* asteroid collisions
* conservation of rotational momentum
* rotation around centre of mass
* laser weapon (goes through everything, instantaneous)
* show starfield video backdrop
* modular synth sound effects
* beat detection input to effects
* custom play controls - continuous encoder and a couple of buttons
* use daisy patch for advanced modulation (beat detect? etc.)

In 1979, Atari made Asteroids on a vector display system they called "XY display" and "Quadrascan" although 
they apparently modified it for every game release. In later games they made colour vector displays.
