# All About Lasers

Things I've learned about scanning show lasers.

## Glossary

**ILDA**: standards body and association

**Scanner**: subassembly with X and Y mirorrs mounted on galvanometers

**Galvanometer**: electromagnetic "motor" for tilting the mirrors - same as you find in retro VU meters that bounce a 
needle to show signal levels.

**PPS**: Points Per Second, also kPPS. Ideally a quoted speed of a laser product's scanners when displaying the ILDA 
Test Pattern at a deflection of 8 degrees. Some lasers do not quote the 8 degree rate, for example some LaserWorld 
models and this is deceptive because the nonlinear relationship between laser speed and deflection makes comparison 
with 8 degree quoted figures "impossible".
