# vectorbrat TODO List

* [x] collect prior art
* [x] attempt to build best existing
* [x] compare existing to rebuild option
* [ ] sanity check
  * [ ] colour
  * [ ] off/on
  * [ ] brightness
  * [ ] dwell points
* [ ] define deployment setup
  * [x] laptop
  * [x] modular rig:
  * [ ] gamepads - HID or special?
* [ ] collect credits to do some kind of credit screen
* [x] practice laser shape jamming
* [ ] vitalise branding

## Game Ideas

* [asteroids](asteroids.md)
* pong
* gravity wars
* star wars ?
* lunar lander
* pinball
* future racing
* gyruss
* night driving

## Stretch goals

* fisheye distortion
* audio visualisations 
* screen shake & compression blasts
* asteroid collisions
* conservation of rotational momentum
* rotation around centre of mass
* laser weapon (goes through everything, instantaneous)
* modular synth sound effects
* beat detection input to effects
* show starfield video backdrop
* custom play controls - continuous encoder and a couple of buttons
* use daisy patch for advanced modulation (beat detect? etc.)

## modular fx

* warps / lens distortion (nonlinear proportional adder)
* screen shake (linear precision adder)

## Effects Ideas

* virtual raster: render horizontal stripes like old IBM logo
* joy division mountains - made from sound input
* star wars text
* 3d rotations with hidden line treatment (e.g. blue making object translucent)
* soft-body physics demos, box 2d demos
* stripes with perturbations
* starfield

## Content Ideas

* image input from artist's instagrams
* welcome to country
* laser overlay on video
